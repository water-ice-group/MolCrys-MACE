# the folder contains example input files
# to produce the file FORCES, i.e.
# a collection of the forces on all atoms 
# for each small displacement required by the code PHON:

# DISP: file produced by PHON with the necessary displacements
# POSCAR: initial geometry
# SPOSCAR: file produced by PHON with the supercell
# INCAR 
# KPOINTS
# runphon.sh: slurm script to compute and collect the forces for each displacement
