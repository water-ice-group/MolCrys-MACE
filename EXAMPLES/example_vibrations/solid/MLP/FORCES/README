# example input files used to compute
# vibrational properties with the small displacement method
# using PHON + MLP

# run-phon.py: python script that computes the forces for a specific displacement (read from runphon.sh) with the MLP
# runphon.sh: slurm script that computes forces on all atoms for each displacement required by phon with the MLP (via run-phon.py)
# INPHON: PHON input use to produce the displacement file DISP
# DISP: list of small displacements
