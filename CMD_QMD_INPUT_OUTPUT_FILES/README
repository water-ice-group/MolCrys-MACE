# the folder contains a sub-folder for each
# system in X23

# in each sub-folder there input/output files for the solid/gas phase
# in the CMD simulation (classic) and QMD simulation (quantum)

# the directories classic_all contain input/output files of the simulations run with the general model
# (as opposed to the system specific models used in the folders classic/quantum)


# the folder gas_cells, unit_cells, super_cells
# contain initital geometries respectively for
# the gas phase
# the solid phase unit cell
# the solid phase super cell
