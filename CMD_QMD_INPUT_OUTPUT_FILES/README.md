The folder contains a sub-folder for each system in X23

In each sub-folder there input/output files for the solid/gas phase in the CMD simulation (classic) and QMD simulation (quantum).

The directories classic_all contain input/output files of the simulations run with the general model 
(as opposed to the system specific models used in the folders classic/quantum).

The folder gas_cells, unit_cells, super_cells contain initital geometries respectively for 

the gas phase

the solid phase unit cell

the solid phase super cell
